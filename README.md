This example shows how scikit-learn can be used to recognize images of
hand-written digits, from 0-9. 
It shows the variation of accuracy with respect to change in GAMMA

Gamma_Value-->	Accuracy 
================================================
1          --> 10.28
	
0.3        --> 10.28

0.1        --> 10.83

0.03       --> 15.83

0.01       --> 71.39

0.003      --> 94.44

0.001      --> 95.83

0.0003     --> 93.89

0.0001     --> 92.22


#OBSERVATIONS

1. As gamma decreases, accuracy increses uptill gamma = 0.001, then accuracy slightly falls.
2. Max value find at gamma = 0.001
3. Step rate = 1/3
